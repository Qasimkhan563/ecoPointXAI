# 🌳 ecoPointXAI — Explainable 3D Forest Intelligence

`ecoPointXAI` provides an end-to-end, explainable 3D forest analytics pipeline built for LiDAR point cloud data.  
It combines **voxel-based ecological feature engineering**, **PointNet deep learning**, and **explainability methods** (SHAP, gradients) to model, visualize, and interpret forest canopy structure in a transparent and reproducible way.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📦 **Voxelization & Preprocessing** — Convert LiDAR point clouds into 3D voxel grids.
- 🌲 **Ecological Metrics** — Compute canopy height, cover, and structural complexity.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning (PointNet)** — Train explainable 3D neural models on voxelized features.
- 🔍 **Explainability** — Apply SHAP or gradient-based methods to interpret model behavior.
- 🎨 **Visualization Tools** — Interactive 3D mapping and metric visualization for ecological insights.

## 🧩 Installation

To install the **development version** from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("qasimkhan563/ecoPointXAI")
```

After installation:

```r
library(ecoPointXAI)
```

## 🚀 Example Usage

```r
library(ecoPointXAI)

# 1️⃣ Read and voxelize a LiDAR point cloud
las_path <- system.file("extdata", "forest_plot.laz", package = "ecoPointXAI")
vox <- preprocess_voxelize(las_path, voxel_size = 1)

# 2️⃣ Compute ecological metrics
metrics <- compute_ecological_metrics(vox)

# 3️⃣ Train a lightweight PointNet model
model <- pointnet_model(num_features = 3, num_classes = 2)

# 4️⃣ Explain model predictions
exp <- explain_pointnet(model, vox, method = "gradients")

# 5️⃣ Visualize explainability in 3D
visualize_explainability(exp)
```

### 🧠 Why use ecoPointXAI?

Traditional 2D raster-based analyses often fail to capture forest structural complexity.  
`ecoPointXAI` bridges 3D deep learning with ecological interpretability—empowering forest scientists to understand *why* their models predict as they do.
