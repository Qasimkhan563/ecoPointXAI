### 🌲 **ecoPointXAI** provides an *explainable 3D forest analytics pipeline* for LiDAR point clouds.  
It bridges **3D deep learning (PointNet)**, **ecological feature engineering**, and **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques — making it possible to model, visualize, and interpret forest canopy structure transparently.

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Voxelization & Preprocessing** — Convert raw LiDAR point clouds into structured 3D voxel grids.  
🌿 **Ecological Metrics** — Derive canopy height, cover, and structural complexity indicators.  
🧠 **Deep Learning (PointNet)** — Train explainable 3D neural models directly on point clouds.  
🔍 **Explainability** — Use SHAP or gradient-based attributions to understand model reasoning.  
🎨 **Visualization Tools** — Render interactive 3D terrain, canopy metrics, and feature importance.

---

## 🧩 Installation

You can install the **development version** from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Qasimkhan563/ecoPointXAI")

library(ecoPointXAI)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Example

```r
library(ecoPointXAI)

# 1️⃣ Load and voxelize a sample LiDAR point cloud
las_path <- system.file("extdata", "forest_plot_small.laz", package = "ecoPointXAI")
vox <- preprocess_voxelize(las_path, voxel_size = 1)

# 2️⃣ Compute ecological canopy metrics
metrics <- compute_ecological_metrics(vox)

# 3️⃣ Train a lightweight PointNet model
model <- pointnet_model(num_features = 3, num_classes = 2)

# 4️⃣ Generate explainability outputs
exp <- explain_pointnet(model, vox, method = "gradients")

# 5️⃣ Visualize feature importance
visualize_explainability(exp)
```

## 🧠 Why ecoPointXAI?

🌍 Traditional 2D raster workflows overlook the 3D structure of forests.  
**ecoPointXAI** brings explainable deep learning into 3D space — allowing scientists to *see why* their models behave as they do, improving interpretability, transparency, and ecological relevance.

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- Built and tested under **R 4.4.x**
- Large example LiDAR file reduced to **<3 MB** for CRAN safety
- Heavy tests and examples are wrapped with `skip_on_cran()`
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows
